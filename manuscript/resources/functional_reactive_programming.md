It’s the sum of streams + transformations + bindings

**Streams**
Streams send stuff. It’s similar to an array but in this case an array is accessed. Streams send things at an specific time.
**Maps**
Convert one thing into another
An stream is transformed into a new stream
New stream are created, not modified the original one
**Binding**
Bind stuff coming from events to things
