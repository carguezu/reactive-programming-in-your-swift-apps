# Thanks

I would like to firs say thanks to *Isaac Roldán*, friend since we met at the University and later workmate at Redbooth. Now working together on new interesting projects. Together we've learnt a lot of concepts, libraries, we've developed a lot of apps and become better developers. I hope this book helps him to absorb all the reactive concepts.

I would like to also thank the big community behind the iOS/OSX development specially to tools like [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) and [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) that make our daily work easier and fluent. Thanks to all these developer that unselfishly work in the platform and have allowed a big source of reusable components that without them it would have been almost impossible.

The community behind **ReactiveCocoa** and **RXSwift** also deserve a big thanks because they made possible the use of Reactive concepts with Swift. They designed both libraries with the advantages that Swift offers as a language *(generics, type safety, type inferece, funcional concepts)*.

And lastly, I would like to thank you for choosing this book to dive into the functional reactive programming. I hope you enjoy it and even more important, that you start adding reactive code in your projects *(I'm pretty sure you're looking forward to doing it)*
